                        Many of us make the mistake of dropping a frame while moving or from our kids
                        playing a bit too rough! Well we have you sorted, bring in your frame and we will
                        fit it with some of our high quality glass options as mentioned above. We can
                        provide a quote over the phone but make sure to visit us to check out the different
                        kinds of glass up close.

                        Here we are ahead of the game using a computerised matboard cutter. This
                        allows us to cut and make just about any shape, any curve and do it with
                        precision. This is perfect for items requiring multiple cutouts such as a
                        winning a competition with multiple medals or a collection of items, we can
                        map out the layout and achieve an amazing looking piece containing multiple
                        items, or if you have a record then we can perfectly map the correct
                        circular shape to fit the circular shape.
