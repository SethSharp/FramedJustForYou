                                    waves a thicker frame to match the colour scheme.

                                            The rest is up to us now! We apply our own backing to keep the
                                            jigsaw in place, it is adhered to the backboard using a pH neutral
                                            dry mount acid free adhesive.
                                        </p>

                                            The overlay is important to preserve the jigsaw and allow you to
                                            clean it. We apply an artshield uv heatseal overlay which is put in
                                            our heat press at 97 degrees. This process also prevents the jigsaw
                                            from fading!
