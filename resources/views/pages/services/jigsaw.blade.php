                            on the right frame that best suits the jigsaw. In this case we have
                            chosen a double frame, with a nice blue colour to accent the ocean
                            waves a thicker frame to match the colour scheme.

                                    The rest is up to us now! We apply our own backing to keep the
                                    jigsaw in place, it is adhered to the backboard using a pH neutral
                                    dry mount acid free adhesive.

                                    The overlay is important to preserve the jigsaw and allow you to
                                    clean it. We apply an artshield uv heatseal overlay which is put in
                                    our heat press at 97 degrees. This process also prevents the jigsaw
                                    from fading!
